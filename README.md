Title: React UI Challenge
 
Objective
The objective of this task is to assess your understanding of React.js concepts and your ability to design and implement user interfaces (UI) using React components. In this challenge, you will be creating your own UI component from scratch, demonstrating your knowledge of React best practices, component structure, and reusability.
 
This is the official first task of the curriculum, based on React Lesson 2, focusing mainly on design implementation, styling and screen responsiveness.
 
Choose one of the designs in the folder and implement the UI exactly as it is.
 
Instructions:
● Download one of the files at the above link.
● Using ReactJS, create a front-end implementation of the UI design.
● Pay close attention to the layout, colours, typography, and overall visual elements to ensure accurate replication.
● You may use your own icons, images, and typography that closely resemble those used in the UI design.
● Use appropriate ReactJS components and styling techniques to achieve the desired design.
● Implement interactivity and responsiveness where applicable.
● Test your implementation thoroughly to ensure proper functionality.
● Bonus: host your work using Github pages or firebase as you have learnt during the bootcamp.
 
Notes:
● While replicating the design, focus on visual fidelity and user experience.
● Use your creativity to find icons, images, typography and colors (color codes) that closely resemble those used in the UI design.
● Apply your knowledge of ReactJS and front-end development best practices to accomplish the task.
● Make use of reusable components wherever possible.
● Feel free to use any additional libraries or tools that you are comfortable with.
● Be attentive to details and strive for accuracy in your implementation.
● Remember, the purpose of this task is to assess your ability to translate a design into a functional UI using ReactJS. If you have any questions or need clarification, please don't hesitate to reach out.
 
Evaluation Criteria:
● Accuracy of the design
○ Was the design layout properly imitated
○ Were the same colors maintained
○ Were similar fonts to those in the design used
○ Were all elements  imitated, is there an element on the design that’s missing on the implementation
● Page interactivity
○ Do links change color when hovered over
○ Do buttons change color when hovered over
● Utilisation of React.js features
○ Did developer create own components
○ Were developer-created components re-used for similar UI elements
● Responsiveness of the page
○ Is the page responsive to different web view sizes
